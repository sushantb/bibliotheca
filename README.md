Repository of building blocks for resilient software systems. The building blocks are implemented using C#/.NET.

These are wrappers/extensions for popular and/or standard technologies that help the developer to focus on customer needs and business logic, not spend effort on boiler plate code:

1. [Observability](./docs/Observability.md) with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [Serilog](https://serilog.net/)
2. `[TODO]` [Data access](./docs/DataAccess.md) with [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper)
